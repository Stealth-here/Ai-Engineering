# üè† House Price Prediction

This project builds a **machine learning model** to predict house prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location. It uses a simple Linear Regression model and includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and performance evaluation.

| Feature       | Description                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Model         | Linear Regression                                |
| Data          | Simulated dataset (Area, Bedrooms, Location, etc.) |
| Libraries     | pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn |
| ML Type       | Supervised Learning - Regression                 |
| Input         | House features (numeric + categorical)           |
| Output        | Predicted price of the house                     |

## üß† Concepts Covered

- One-Hot Encoding for categorical features
- Feature scaling (if needed)
- Train-test split
- Model training and evaluation
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
